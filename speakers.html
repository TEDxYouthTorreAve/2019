      <h2> Neha W.</h2>
      <h4>The Importance of Biculturalism </h4>
    <p> Neha Washikar is a Junior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino,
        California. She has been practicing Indian Classical dance for the
        past 12 years and can speak 6 languages. In her free time, she likes
        to hang out with friends, paint, and play volleyball. Growing up in
        the Bay Area, she noticed many children of immigrants did not pay much
        attention to their parent's culture. Her talk, "The Importance of Biculturalism
        in a Multicultural World" outlines what it means to have cultural awareness and
        explains the numerous personal and professional benefits of being bicultural.</p>

      <h2> Shanlea T.</h2>
      <h4>The Psychology Behind Climate Change </h4>
        <p> Shanlea Tabofunda is 16 and a junior at Cupertino High School.
        She will be speaking about the psychology behind climate change,
        discussing the psychological barriers preventing individuals from
        acting against one of humanity’s most pressing threats. As citizens,
        we are constantly inundated with statistics that don’t motivate us
        to change our behavior, but by understanding the science behind our
        actions, we can ignite a significant change in our own lives.</p>

          <h4>Generation Z Making an Impact</h4>
        <p> Samvi Ranka is an 8th grader at Lawson Middle School
        from Silicon Valley. Generation Z is fortunate enough
        to be in the midst of the digital and social media revolution.
        This entire exposure gives them so many opportunities and ideas
        that could be used towards helping a worthwhile cause and make
        the world a better place. In Samvi’s speech, “Generation Z making
        an impact one step at a time," she wants to inspire all her
        Generation Z people out there who have so many influential ideas.
        By sharing her journey and experience, she wants all young people
        out there to be able to take risks that would lead to an
        applause-worthy product and make the world a better place,
        one step at a time. </p>

              <h2> Srutika S.</h2>
              <h4>The Bubble of Silicon Valley </h4>
            <p> Srutika Sureshbabu is a 15-year-old sophomore at Cupertino High School.
              She is a captain for the Speech and Debate team and president of the Tino
               Student Doctors club. Srutika uses these platforms to advocate for
               students’ well being by propagating a collaborative environment. In her
                free time, she enjoys doing Indian classical dance as well as
                binge-reading book series. In “The Bubble of Silicon Valley,” Srutika
                explains how growing up in Silicon Valley can be a conflicting whirlwind
                of an experience. With the influence of the tech industries and the
                competitive spirit, students struggle to find a balance that allows
                them to prosper. </p>

              <h4>Navigating the Social Media Minefield </h4>
                <p> Aniruddh Suresh is a Junior at Cupertino High School. He enjoys
                playing percussion, going out mountain biking and playing video
                games. He’s also an active member of his school’s speech and debate
                club, competing for and helping run the team. Using personal
                experiences, along with those of friends and family, he focused
                his attention to a growing problem in the modern world today.
                His talk, “Navigating the Social Media Minefield,” focuses on the
                vulnerabilities that are exploited in order to take advantage of
                the millions of people who are using social media, and he hopes
                to provide a greater awareness of how to protect those who could
                potentially fall victim to such schemes. </p>

			<h2>Speaking Guidelines</h2>
			<span class="byline">Sharing Your Ideas with the Community</span>
			<span class="byline">Be familar with your topic</span>
		</div>
	<p>This topic can cover anything from STEM to
		art. Each speaker will deliver a 8-10 minute speech about their topic
		to foster learning, spark conversation and inspire the members of a more
		connected community</p>
		<p>TEDx has a specific format that must be followed to maintain its high
			standards. Watch some TEDx videos to better understand this format. </p>

			<p> Like a good magazine article, your idea can be new or surprising,
				or challenge a belief your audience already has. Or it can be a great
				basic idea with a compelling new argument behind it. An idea isn’t
				just a story or a list of facts. A good idea takes evidence or
				observations and draws a larger conclusion.</p>
			<p> You do not need to be the world’s foremost expert on the topic,
				but you do have to be well informed and make sure your idea is backed
				by reliable data. If you are presenting a call to action, make sure it
				can be executed by members of your audience.</p>
				<p>The TEDxYouth@TorreAvenue team will help you further refine and
					effectively deliver your idea.</p>
          <div class="title">
      			<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
          </div>
        <p> 1. All speakers must be (ages 13 to 18)</p>
        <p> 2. All speakers must be a student enrolled in the FUHSD, LASD, or surrounding areas.</p>
        <p> 3. Your "Idea Worth Spreading" must be your own and may not address
          political/religious agendas or directly promote a company, business, or product. </p>
        <p> 4. You will be required to sign a video release form for TED and Cupertino Library so that your talk
          may be recorded and uploaded online. </p>
        <p> 5. You must be willing to meet with a speaking coach and event coordinators before the event for
          practice, dress rehearsal, etc. Specific dates and times will be determined later and communicated
          at least a few days in advance.</p>
        <p> 6. If the organizing committee of TEDxYouth@TorreAve determines that you are not fully prepared
          to deliver your talk, you may be cut from the team of speakers at any time. This would in no way
          be a reflection of your abilities, but rather a choice necessary for upholding the TEDx standards.</p>
        <p> 7. You must be present on the event, Saturday, June 8th.
